                    <li>Your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where you live (if you are in
                        the U.S.), or your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where your service
                        provider is located (if you are not in the U.S.); and

                    <li>Your consent to accept and abide to the service of process from the party who submitted the takedown
                        notice (complainant) or an agent of that said party.
                    </li>

                    disabled material may be replaced, or your access to it restored in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business
                    days after receiving the counter-notice.</p>
                <p><strong>REPEAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINT POLICY</strong></p>
                <p>If <strong>Brand</strong> receives repeated notices that you have used in your campaigns and merchandise
                    intellectual property without permission or authorization, Brand may terminate your account. Brand keeps
                    track of intellectual property rights infringement cases, and users with repeat violations, which Brand
                    uses to determine when to suspend or terminate your account.</p>
                <p>In most cases, when content is removed or blocked because of a legal request to do so from the
                    intellectual property owner, you will incur an intellectual property strike. Penalties will vary with
                    the number of strikes incurred over a one-year period:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Three (3) intellectual property strikes will get your account will be suspended for one (1) month.
                    </li>
                    <li>Four (4) intellectual property strikes will get your account will be suspended for three (3)
                        months.
                    </li>
                    <li>Five (5) intellectual property strikes will get your account will be suspended for six (6) months.
                    </li>
                    <li>Six (6) or more&nbsp; intellectual property strikes will get your account terminated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you submit a counter-notice to dispute the intellectual property owner’s complaint and that
                    counter-notice is not acknowledged or answered by the intellectual property owner, or if the dispute
                    leads to legal proceedings and the court findings clearly states that you have not infringed the owner’s
                    intellectual property, <strong>brand</strong> will take away the incurred strike for the said violation.
                    Likewise, if the intellectual property owner retracts the notice or complaint, <strong>brand</strong>
                    will remove the strike.</p>
                <p>Brand has the right to terminate accounts that violated its Terms of Service, regardless of how many
                    strikes are involved.</p>
                <h4><strong>BRAND RESPECTS THE PRIOR, LEGITIMATE RIGHTS OF THE FIRST TO PUBLISH A CAMPAIGN</strong></h4>
                <p>In some cases, later campaigns copy earlier built campaigns that contain original artwork on our site.
                    Our policy is that every original image or design uploaded onto <strong>Brand</strong> is protected
                    against exact duplication, or use in a confusingly similar (trademark) or substantially similar
                    (copyright) manner.</p>
                <p>Brand will accept infringement complaints and notifications from customers that claim ownership of the
                    aforementioned original content from an earlier campaign.</p>
                <p>When notified, Brand, in its discretion, may remedy any alleged infringement by temporary removing
                    unauthorized content. Alternatively, Brand may notify the allegedly infringing party and provide a
                    warning. Further infractions may lead to suspension or termination of the alleged infringing party’s
                    account.</p>
                <p>If you want to know more about these policies, please reference Brand’s Frequently Asked Questions
                    section.</p>
                <p>If you spotted a merchandise or campaign that contains your original image or design and would like to
                    report it to Brand, send us a notification at support@BurgerPrints.com with the following
                    information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The web address(es) / URL(s) that contains the sale of the allegedly infringing merchandise; and
                    </li>
                    <li>The web address(es) / URL(s) of your campaign and date of first use.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>WITHHOLDING AND TAX MATTERS</strong></h4>
                <p>It is understood that the transactions and services aforementioned in this Agreement will not impose a
                    withholding obligation upon Brand under Section 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the
                    “Code”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Brand concludes that it has an obligation to withhold under
                    Section 1442 of the Code (or other applicable law) with respect to Profits of the Seller, Brand will
                    withhold all applicable income tax from any payments or Seller Profits otherwise due to Seller.</p>
                <p>The Seller shall be solely responsible for payment of its own taxes, which may be referenced or arise
                    under the Agreement, and shall cover Brand for any tax obligations, including for federal income tax
                    withholding, which may arise as a result of this Agreement.</p>
                <h4><strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong></h4>
                <p>Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Brand and its affiliates, employees, officers,
                    directors, and agents from and against all suits, claims, demands, actions, damages, liabilities,
                    losses, settlements, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) which may arise out of or in
                    relation to (i) any content posted&nbsp; or submitted by the Seller, (ii) The Seller’s use of, or in
                    connection with Brand’s website, (iii) Seller’s violation of any of the terms specified in this
                    Agreement or the Terms of Service, or (iv) Seller’s violation of any rights of a third party. To secure
                    Seller’s complete and prompt&nbsp; payment and performance of any and all present and future
                    indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of Seller to Brand, including with respect to any
                    indemnification arising out of the Agreement or the Terms of Service, the Seller hereby grants Brand a
                    security interest in all of the Seller’s proceeds of the merchandise from the Brand website (including
                    Seller Profits and insurance proceeds). Brand shall be entitled to all applicable rights and remedies of
                    a secured party under applicable law.</p>
                <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL BRAND AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TERMS
                    OF SERVICE, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR
                    OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT OTHERWISE OWED TO SELLER AS SELLER PROFIT.</p>
                <h4><strong>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Terms of Agreement Prevail Over Seller’s Campaign Purchase Order.</strong>&nbsp;The parties
                    intend for the express terms and conditions contained in this Agreement (including any schedules and

                    to bind or create any obligations on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind the other
                    party to any contract, agreement or undertaking with any third party without the receiving party’s prior
                    content.</p>
                <p>Entire Agreement.&nbsp;This Agreement (and the Terms of Service) constitute the entire agreement of the
                    parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and
